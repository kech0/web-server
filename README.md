# web-server
A simple web-server using python

# README.md python server 
To create a server and manage it , is quite simple .Using the Ip address of the host and specifying the port is the key to everything concerning 
the server , while building your own make sure not to publish your own IP address .Instead hosting your server locally is the best . When making a post request you'll type
"YOUR IP":"PORT" -X POST .If you get an error response it is because nothing is implemented , all we need to do is add an additional function , do_POST.
